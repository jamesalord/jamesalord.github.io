Rehab
=====
The knee was due for 2  physcal therapy sessions a week for 12 weeks.  I got a list of PTs from the doctor, then started calling.  No one seemed to take my insurance (Cygna).  So I called Cygna, and was told there was only 1 PT in Oakland.  That PT had a wait of 2.5+ weeks for the first visit.  So I check with my insurance and my out of network cost is not too bad.  So I called back to the Doctor's first choice and saw a PT that I'm now in week 3 and getting better every visit.

The primary goal has been to get my leg to straighten.  I have been walking for weeks with a slightly bent leg, which has caused my calf to periodically cramp.  

The cast was removed and pins pulled after 5 weeks.  I'm currently working
