Seven Schools
=============

For a long time, I have loved Ikibana -- the Japanese art of flower arranging.  A recent change in my living arrangements freed up some time, so I decided to finally look into this art form that had so piqued my interest.  Much to my delight, I discovered that there was an upcoming Ikebana exhibition in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park the following weekend.  Off I went to show, and was rewarded with amazing arrangments, many styles, and artisans who where happy to share their knowledge and approaches.

The history of Ikebana reaches far back in Japanese history -- all the way to the 6th century when Buddhism came to Japan.  People would spread flowers on the graves of the dead to honor them.  It started with the spread of petals, but later became full arrangements.  In the 10th century, one priest from the Rokkakudo Temple in Kyoto became reknown for his arrangments. Since he was by a _lake_, 'Ike', and a _priest_ 'Bo', and 'No' means _of the_, ikibono loosely translates to _priest of the lake_.  Later on, Ikebono moved beyond its religious origins into palaces, then into formal tea cerimonies and finally into homes.

The earliest style was Kuge, which emphasises simplicity with a few flower stems and branches (typically 3, representing the harmony of man, heaven and earth - the photo below is in this style).  Later, the Rikka style was developed which had 7 stems, representing the different elements of nature -- peak, hill, waterfall, town, valley, sunlit side, and the shady side.  In the 19th and 20th centuries, the rules increasingly were relaxed and a plethora of styles emerged each championed by their attendant schools.

Here is a quick rundown of the the schools presenting at the show, and a little bit about each one:
