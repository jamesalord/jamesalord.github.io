<p>James works hard and tries to not take himself too seriously.  A steep ski slope and a soccer pitch are two of his happy places.  What he lacks in soccer touch and skill, he makes up with determination and a general willingness to collide with other players, including those on his own team.  Off the pitch, after the steeps and outside of the workplace, James dabbles in creating "art" to share with others on the playa.</p>

<p>In his spare time, James works as a Operations guy who tells stories about the billions of data points his team collects.</p>

<p>James is also extremely lucky to be the proud father of two wonderful kids.  He currently resides in Oakland, California</p>
